Hey, This is Rock_vs_mine prediction project. In it we will find out that for a given data, is that a rock or mine.
We will use some most common and important libraries like numpy, pandas, skitlearn and matplotlib here. 
In this project, we are doing a classification task. Cause we need to find out is given data about rock or about mine.
For doing so, we will use logistic regression model.
We will use train_test_split to divide the data into training and testing part.
we will train the logistic regression model on training data, then evaluate it's accuracy on testing data.
After getting a nice accuracy, we will create a short predicton system which will tell us is given data about rock or about mine.
